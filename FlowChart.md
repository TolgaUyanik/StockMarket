Project Flowchart: TradingView to Python Conversion
This document outlines the steps for converting TradingView Pine scripts to a Python-based backtesting and analysis system.

Phase 1: Planning and Script Selection
Task 1.1: Create a definitive list of all TradingView Pine scripts to be converted.

Task 1.2: Categorize the scripts based on their function (e.g., trend-following, momentum, volatility, custom indicators).

Task 1.3: Prioritize the scripts for conversion, starting with the most critical or simplest ones.

Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Task 2.1: Write a dedicated Python script to fetch historical and real-time market data using libraries like yfinance.

Task 2.2: Develop functions to clean and handle missing or corrupted data points (e.g., using forward-fill or interpolation).

Task 2.3: Implement a preprocessing function to ensure all dataframes have the standardized Open, High, Low, Close, Volume column headers required by pandas-ta.

Phase 3: Script Conversion
Task 3.1: Translate standard Pine script indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, ADX) into their pandas-ta function calls.

Task 3.2: Recreate custom Pine script logic, such as crossover() and crossunder(), using vectorized Pandas operations for efficiency.

Task 3.3: Run validation tests to ensure the converted Python functions produce identical or highly similar results to the original Pine scripts.

Phase 4: Backtesting and Analysis
Task 4.1: Build a backtesting framework that can simulate trades based on entry and exit signals from your converted strategies.

Task 4.2: Calculate and display key performance metrics, including profitability, win rate, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe Ratio.

Task 4.3: Use a visualization library like matplotlib to generate charts that show the strategy's performance, equity curve, and individual trade signals.

Phase 5: Continuous Improvement
Task 5.1: Compare the backtest results with the theoretical results from TradingView to identify and fix any discrepancies.

Task 5.2: Optimize the data fetching and backtesting scripts for better performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Task 5.3: Create a system for regularly updating the data and re-running the backtests to ensure the strategies remain valid.

Phase 6: Deployment and Automation
Task 6.1: Set up a scheduled task to automatically fetch the latest data and run the backtesting process daily.

Task 6.2: Develop an alerting mechanism to send real-time signals (e.g., email or push notifications) when a trading opportunity is detected.

Task 6.3: Integrate your backtesting engine with a live trading API to execute trades automatically based on your strategy's signals.

Phase 7: Advanced Analysis and Machine Learning
Task 7.1: Begin exploring machine learning models to predict market trends or optimize strategy parameters.

Task 7.2: Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the robustness of your strategies under various market conditions.

Task 7.3: Build a portfolio management tool to analyze and manage the performance of multiple assets and strategies simultaneously.
