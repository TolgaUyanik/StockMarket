    "\n",
    "### **Volume Breakout Strategy**\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Price near resistance with declining volume\n",
    "2. **Trigger**: Volume surge (2x+ average) on breakout\n",
    "3. **Entry**: Buy the breakout with volume confirmation\n",
    "4. **Stop**: Below breakout point or volume support level\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Volume Delta Strategy**\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Monitor volume delta during price moves\n",
    "2. **Bullish Signal**: Price up + positive delta increasing\n",
    "3. **Bearish Signal**: Price up + negative delta increasing (divergence)\n",
    "4. **Entry**: Trade in direction of volume delta\n",
    "\n",
    "### **VWAP Reversion Strategy**\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Price moves significantly away from VWAP\n",
    "2. **Entry**: Enter when price begins returning toward VWAP\n",
    "3. **Target**: VWAP level or beyond\n",
    "4. **Stop**: If price continues away from VWAP\n",
